# ðŸŽ§ EARS: Environmental Acoustic Response Simulator

**EARS** is a GPU-accelerated 3D acoustics simulation framework that models physically accurate sound propagation using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) schemes.

Developed as part of a diploma thesis at the National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, this software is designed for researchers, engineers, and developers interested in wave-based audio simulation, architectural acoustics, immersive media, and dataset generation for machine learning.
